# Codexis Landing Page

## Overview

A modern, engaging landing page for Codexis - a revolutionary SaaS tool that transforms software codebases into immersive 3D cities for developers. The landing page showcases the product's innovative spatial code visualization concept with stunning 3D aesthetics and interactive elements.

## Design Philosophy

### Core Concept: "Don't read your codebase. Walk through it."

The landing page reflects Codexis's revolutionary approach to code visualization by:
- Using 3D design elements that mirror the product's spatial navigation concept
- Implementing floating geometric shapes representing code blocks
- Creating interactive demonstrations of 3D code exploration
- Employing a tech-forward aesthetic with gradients, animations, and modern effects

### Visual Design Principles
